# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python
The repository conatins the Data structures and alogorithms which are implemented in python.
Data structures are efficient ways of storing information.(We have to consider the effective addition, deletion,searching and access).
Algorithms are step by step process of solving a problem.

<h4>Some notable Data structures are:</h4><br>
<ol>
  <li>Stacks</li>
  <li>Queues</li>
  <li>Linked Lists</li>
  <li>Doubly Linked Lists</li>
  <li>Binary Search Trees</li>
  <li>AVL Tree(Self Balancing BST)</li>
</ol>
